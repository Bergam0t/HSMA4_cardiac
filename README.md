# HSMA4_cardiac
HSMA4 project on reducing cardiac surgery travel times

A project by Antonia Drummond, Janine James, Glenn Ubly and Victor Yu as part of the HSMA4 programme.
This is a geographical and statistical investigation into the travel times for cardiac valve surgery patients.
The code here is for a Streamlit app which allows the user to select configurations of cardiac surgery sites in the Kent and Medway area and compare the impact on travel times for the population of patients.
